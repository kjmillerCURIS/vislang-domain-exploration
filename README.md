# vislang-domain-exploration

## Description

The purpose of this project is to use language as a signal for visual domain adaptation/generalization. This is a particularly interesting research direction given the rise of large vision-language-pretrained models like CLIP.

## Exploratory Probing

As a first step, let's try and explore the embedding space of CLIP with some handcrafted inputs, just to see how it represents domains.
